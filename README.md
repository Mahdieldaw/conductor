# Hybrid Thinking OS

A powerful workflow automation system that combines a web-based Control Panel with a browser extension Sidecar to execute multi-step AI workflows on live LLM websites like ChatGPT and Claude.

## üöÄ Features

### Phase 5: Workflow Engine & Memory Management

- **Multi-Step Workflow Execution**: Define and execute complex workflows with multiple prompts
- **Intelligent Memory Management**: Tiered storage system with hot cache and cold storage
- **Real-time Workflow Monitoring**: Track workflow progress and status in real-time
- **Session History**: Browse and analyze past workflow executions
- **Error Handling & Recovery**: Robust error handling with detailed logging
- **Tab Management**: Execute workflows on specific browser tabs

### Core Components

- **Control Panel**: React-based web application for workflow management
- **Sidecar Extension**: Browser extension for executing workflows on LLM websites
- **Shared Messaging**: Common message types and communication protocols
- **Memory System**: Dual-tier storage for workflow sessions and results

A system composed of two primary components:

1. **The Control Panel**: A web application where users can define, manage, and execute multi-step AI workflows (called "recipes")
2. **The Sidecar Extension**: A browser extension that acts as a local "API" to execute workflow steps on live LLM websites (like ChatGPT and Claude)

## Project Structure

This is a pnpm monorepo with the following packages:

## Phase 2: Web App (Control Panel) üñ•Ô∏è

**Status: COMPLETED**

- [x] Scaffold with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Implement SidecarService.js for extension communication
- [x] Build main interface and provider selection
- [x] Add prompt composer, template bar, and results display

## Phase 3: Integration & Core Reliability (Current Focus) üîÑ

**Goal:** Achieve a fully reliable, session-aware, and robust connection from the UI to LLM tabs, with advanced error handling and session management.

- [x] Connect UI to SidecarService: Wire PromptComposer to the refactored executePrompt service.
- [x] Implement Basic WorkflowRunner.js for single-prompt recipes.
- [x] State Management & Result Display: UI for displaying responses.
- [x] Implement TabSessionManager:
  - [x] Create `tab-manager.js` for tab tracking.
  - [x] Create `tab-session-manager.js` for per-tab session IDs using `chrome.storage.session`.
  - [x] Integrate session reset and new chat logic (`startNewChat`) across UI, service worker, and content scripts.
- [x] Refactor SidecarService and Service Worker:
  - [x] Remove "always-reload" behavior.
  - [x] Integrate getSession/resetSession logic based on UI toggle.
  - [x] Normalize all provider responses for robust error handling.
- [x] Build the Three-Stage Readiness Pipeline:
  - [x] Implement `<ReadinessGate>` UI and `useReadinessFlow` hook.
  - [x] Add service worker logic for tab readiness and recovery.
  - [x] Add readiness-detector.js content script with login/ready markers.

## Technical Implementation Notes

- **Core Services:** IntentService and WorkflowRunner are being modularized for maintainability and testability.
- **Workflow Library:** New workflow types (e.g., compare, critique) will be added as JSON contracts and tested automatically.
- **Persistent Memory:** Session history will be stored using `chrome.storage.local` to enable advanced memory features.
- **Observability:** Logging and step-by-step progress will be surfaced in the UI for transparency and debugging.
- **Testing & Infrastructure:** Automated tests and error harmonization will ensure reliability across extension and web app.
- **Metrics:** Key metrics (trust, accuracy, engagement) will be instrumented to guide product decisions.

### Shared Messaging Package

The `@hybrid-thinking/messaging` package exports the following message type constants:

- `PING` - Health check message
- `EXECUTE_PROMPT` - Execute a prompt on an LLM platform
- `HARVEST_RESPONSE` - Harvest the latest response from a provider
- `BROADCAST_PROMPT` - Send a prompt without harvesting
- `TASK_COMPLETE` - Indicates a task has finished
- `GET_AVAILABLE_TABS` - List all detected LLM tabs
- `RESET_SESSION` - Reset session for a provider/tab
- `START_NEW_CHAT` - Trigger new chat in content script
