\# Hybrid Thinking OS

A system composed of two primary components:

1. **The Control Panel**: A web application where users can define, manage, and execute multi-step AI workflows (called "recipes")
2. **The Sidecar Extension**: A browser extension that acts as a local "API" to execute workflow steps on live LLM websites (like ChatGPT and Claude)

## Project Structure

This is a pnpm monorepo with the following packages:

```

## Phase 0: Foundation & Monorepo Setup ‚úÖ

**Status: COMPLETED**

- [x] Initialize the monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- [x] Create shared messaging package with message type constants
- [x] Set up placeholder packages for web-app and sidecar-extension
- [x] Configure workspace dependencies and scripts
- [x] Verify package linking and exports

## Phase 1: Sidecar Extension Core üöÄ

**Status: COMPLETED**

- [x] Scaffold extension with Vite and web-extension plugin
- [x] Integrate Provider and Detector logic
- [x] Implement ServiceWorker.js and content.js
- [x] Create test harness for validation
- [x] Implement robust tab registry and message routing
- [x] Normalize broadcast and harvest response structures with metadata

## Phase 2: Web App (Control Panel) üñ•Ô∏è

**Status: COMPLETED**

- [x] Scaffold with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Implement SidecarService.js for extension communication
- [x] Build main interface and provider selection
- [x] Add prompt composer, template bar, and results display
- [x] Implement parallel prompt execution and robust state management
- [x] Add error handling and retry logic for individual providers

## Phase 3: Integration & Core Reliability (Current Focus) üîÑ

**Goal:** Implement the complete, reliable connection from the UI to a target tab, including readiness and session architecture.

- [x] Connect UI to SidecarService: Wire the main PromptComposer to the newly refactored executePrompt service.
- [x] Implement Basic WorkflowRunner.js: Initial scaffolding for executing simple, single-prompt "recipes".
- [x] State Management & Result Display: Implement the UI for displaying a single response from a successful execution.
- [ ] Build the Three-Stage Readiness Pipeline:
  - Implement the <ReadinessGate> UI component and useReadinessFlow hook.
  - Develop service worker logic for findOrPromptTab, ensureTabIsReady, and progressive recovery (reload) functions.
  - Create readiness-detector.js content script with platform-specific loginMarkers and readyMarkers.
- [ ] Implement the TabSessionManager:
  - Create tab-manager.js to handle creating, retrieving, and clearing per-tab sessionIds using chrome.storage.session.
- [ ] Refactor SidecarService.executePrompt:
  - Remove "always-reload" behavior.
  - Integrate getSession/resetSession logic based on the continueChat UI toggle.

## Phase 4: Technical Hardening & Observability üõ°Ô∏è

**Goal:** Solidify the foundation with robust error handling, logging, and support for multiple providers.

- [ ] Harmonize Error Messages: Implement error-classifier.js to ensure errors from the Readiness Pipeline (e.g., tab_not_open, login_required) are cleanly handled and displayed in the UI.
- [ ] Implement Simple Logging Bus: Capture key events from the Readiness Pipeline and executePrompt (e.g., "Gate 1 Passed," "Session Reset," "Prompt Executed").
- [ ] Surface "Step X of N" Progress in UI: Initially, this will apply to the Readiness Pipeline gates ("Step 1 of 3: Checking for open tab...").
- [ ] Add Support for Additional LLM Providers: Create new configuration files for ChatGPT, Gemini, etc., specifying their unique readiness markers for the pipeline.
- [ ] UI/UX Polish: Refine the loading states and user guidance messages within the <ReadinessGate> component.
- [ ] Implement advanced error recovery and retry strategies
- [ ] Add detailed logging and analytics
- [ ] Polish UI/UX and accessibility
- [ ] Prepare for public release

## Phase 5: Persistent Memory & Advanced Workflows üß†

**Goal:** Move beyond single-shot prompts to multi-step workflows with persistent history.

- [ ] Implement Persistent Memory (chrome.storage.local): Cache the last 10 sessions. A "session" is now defined by its sessionId and includes the initial prompt, the final output, and trace logs.
- [ ] Add Advanced Workflow Features: Enhance WorkflowRunner.js to handle multi-step workflows. The Readiness Pipeline + Session ID pattern now ensures that each step in a workflow can be reliably executed against the target tab.
- [ ] Add New Workflow Types: Define "compare" or "critique" workflows as JSON contracts.
- [ ] Automate contract testing for each workflow to prevent regressions and ensure reliability
- [ ] Lay groundwork for a more advanced memory layer in future phases

## Phase 6: Extension Infrastructure & Metrics üìä

**Status: PLANNED**

- [ ] Automate extension reload and end-to-end workflow tests in a headless browser
- [ ] Instrument a dashboard to track key metrics (trust score, MVI accuracy, time-to-first-synthesis, engagement, retention, adoption rate)
- [ ] Use these metrics to guide further technical and product decisions

## Phase 7: Advanced Memory & Provider Abstraction (Future) üöÄ

**Status: FUTURE**

- [ ] Build a Phase 3 memory layer with cold storage and vector indexing for semantic search
- [ ] Develop a plugin architecture for supporting both content-script and API-based providers

## Technical Implementation Roadmap (Summary)

1. **Isolate & Harden Core Services**
   - Refactor IntentService and WorkflowRunner out of the monolithic service worker into dedicated, unit-tested modules.
   - Define a versioned intent schema to ensure consistent interpretation of user intent.
   - This reduces the risk of service worker bloat and misinterpretation in the Model-View-Intent (MVI) engine.
2. **Expand & Validate Workflow Library**
   - Add new workflow types (e.g., ‚Äúcompare‚Äù, ‚Äúcritique‚Äù) as JSON contracts.
   - Automate contract testing for each workflow to prevent regressions and ensure reliability.
3. **Implement Persistent Memory**
   - Use chrome.storage.local to cache the last 10 sessions, including prompts, outputs, and trace logs.
   - Lays the groundwork for a more advanced memory layer in future phases.
4. **Observability & Traceability**
   - Implement a simple logging bus for capturing intermediate outputs and step-by-step status.
   - Surface ‚Äústep X of N‚Äù progress in the UI to improve transparency and user trust.
5. **Robust Extension & Testing Infrastructure**
   - Automate extension reload and end-to-end workflow tests in a headless browser.
   - Harmonize error messages between the sidecar extension and the UI for a seamless user experience.
6. **Advanced Memory & Provider Abstraction (Future)**
   - Build a Phase 3 memory layer with cold storage and vector indexing for semantic search.
   - Develop a plugin architecture for supporting both content-script and API-based providers.
7. **Metrics & Risk Mitigation**
   - Instrument a dashboard to track key metrics (trust score, MVI accuracy, time-to-first-synthesis, engagement, retention, adoption rate).
   - Use these metrics to guide further technical and product decisions.

### Immediate Next Steps

- Refactor IntentService and WorkflowRunner as standalone modules.
- Build a demo of the synthesis loop for marketing and user onboarding.
- Set up the KPI dashboard before beta launch.
- Launch the insider beta and collect real user feedback to iterate on technical and UX issues.

**In summary:**
The technical roadmap is tightly coupled to user experience goals, with a focus on modularizing core logic, expanding and testing workflows, adding persistent memory, improving observability, and building robust infrastructure for future growth and risk mitigation.
